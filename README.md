# Advanced Artificial Intelligence Final Project

The final project of this course was about designing and implementing a Multi-Agent environment for 4 predators in a 20\*20 grid with 8 unlimited food sources. </br>

* Every time an agent feeds from a food-source, it will recieve a +1 reward.
* Every time an agent is under attack, it recieves a reward of -4.
* Every time an agent attacks another agent, it will recieve a reward of +2.
* Every time an agent attacks an empty cell in the grid, it will recieve a reward of -0.1.

Our goal is to find the best policy for achieving maximum reward. </br>

I used Q-learning for training the agents.

Here, you can find my code.
